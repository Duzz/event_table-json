# Playing with JSON

### Goal 
List out contents of *JSON* file to a bootstraps table. Also get a feel for what information people may be looking for if they came upon an even list. Learn more about JSON requests.



### JSON Data
- Location: 
    - Name of where event is taking place
    - City
    - Full address (if I incorporate google maps I can omit this and just use their data)
    - Location URL (not currently listed but I should add a link to a website or Facebook page)
- Date: The date the event is happening (should add time too I guess)
- URL: Link to buy tickets for event (could be set up with a square-up or strip account to make simple)

### Extras

- Use google maps API
- Custom google maps display (I don't like their colors or icons)
- Modal that displays mini-map of location along with options to buy a ticket, go to location URL, and get directions.
- Display events from most current to future events, while ignoring past events.
- Limit view to 5 but have a drop-down view for more.
